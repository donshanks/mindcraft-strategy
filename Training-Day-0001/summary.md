# Training Day 0001

__Seed__: -1447635903

Ended Day 23.

Spawned inside a mountain biome. Adjacent to both plains and desert biomes.

- [x] Mark the spot
- [x] Punch some trees to make wooden tools
- [x] Find Stone and make stone tools
- [x] Find Coal
- [x] Find 3 Sheep & Make a bed

Built a small block home into the side of the mountain, maybe 20 blocks from the spawn point. About sea level, maybe Y = 68.

Starting digging to get Iron. Found Lapis before I found iron but I couldn't mine it yet.
Around level 27, I busted through the top of a very large cavern, probaly a 40+ block drop to the floor. I went up 2-3 blocks
and started to go sideways, eventually found some iron to start making armor. Eventually got enough iron to complete the armor
and a shiled, bucket and shears. Got deep enough to get some cobbled deepslate. Headed up to search for a Tiaga biome.

Lots of desert and savannah, by the time I found a Tiaga it was small and bordered by more desert and swamp. My shield is 
about dead and I am out of iron, will need to start mining from scratch.
